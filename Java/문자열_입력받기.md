# Java에서 문자열 입력받기
In Java, Scanner and BufferedReader class are sources that serve as ways of reading inputs.

## 1. BufferedReader vs Scanner in Java

1. **Buffer Memory:** BufferedReader has larger buffer memory(8KB or 8192 chars) than Scanner which has (1KB or 1024 chars). It means if you are reading a large String than you should use BufferedReader. If the user input is short or other than String, you can use Scanner.

2. **Functionality:** BufferedReader is used to read the data only. Scanner not only read the data but also parse the data.

Scanner uses regular expression to read and parse text. 
It can use custom delimiter and parse text into primitive data type for e,g short, long, int 
using `nextShort(), nextLong(), nextInt()` methods. BufferedReader can only read String using readLine() method.

3. **Performance:** BufferedReader is faster than Scanner because BufferedReader does not need to parse the data.

4. **Data type:** BufferedReader can read only String. Scanner can read String as well as primitive data types (int, float, double, long, short).

5. **Introduction to JDK:** BufferedReader was introduced in JDK 1.1 while Scanner was introduced in JDK1.5 .

6. **Synchronization:** BufferedReader is synchronized while Scanner is not. For multi-threading applications BufferedReader is preferred.

7. **Checked Exception:** BufferedReader throws CheckedException(i.e IOException) while Scanner does not throw any CheckedException.

8. **Package:** BufferedReader class is present in java.io package while Scanner class is present in java.util package.

9. Scanner는 Space, Enter 모두 경계로 입력값을 인식하는 반면, BufferedReader는 Enter만을 경계로 입력값을 인식한다.


## 2. Example
### 2-1. BufferedReader
```
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();    
        sb.append(bufferedReader.readLine());
        
        // default type is String. So, type conversion is needed.
        int num = Integer.parseInt(bufferedReader.readLine());
        
        bufferedReader.close();
   }
}
```

```
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        String str = br.readLine();

        // blank separate method 1
        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(str);
        int a = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
        int b = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());

        // blank separate method 2
        String [] strArr = str.split(" ");

        br.close();
    }
}
```
